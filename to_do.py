equipped items should be a single dictionary
    equipped = { mainhand: [], armor: [], ......} etc
    
dialogue should be a default dict so i can add places without dialouge and not get an error

the function mapping may be able to replaced by using enumerate with an ordered dictionary

equipping needs to check if you already have something equipped
